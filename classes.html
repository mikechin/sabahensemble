    <h2>Belly Dance From The Inside Out
with The Sabah Ensemble</h2>
    
  	  <p>Imagery, body alignment, energy awareness and technique lead us to the connected, expressive, and ancient dance form of belly dancing.  Using Jamie “Sabah” Miller’s teachings, we will gain a deeper understanding of the body’s support systems to release holding patterns and to allow for the flow of energy and a greater range of movement.</p>
	<h4> Thursday Evenings 7:45pm to 9:45pm (doors open 7:30)</h4>
   	<h4>Berkeley Moving Arts/ Western Sky Studios</h4>
	<h4>2525 8th St. #13A Berkeley, CA 94710 <a href="location.html">(street parking available)</a></h4>
    
    <h2>Our class welcomes first time students on the first Thursday of the month</h2>
    <p>The single introductory class is $15, or if you'd like to continue working with us, you can pay for that month's series.</p>
    
    <h2>Our class operates as a monthly series of $50</h2>
    <p>Work exchange is available.  Please speak with us for special arrangements, such as partial months.</p>
    
    <h2>This is a multi-level class</h2>
    <p>All levels welcome.  Classes are taught by <a href="teachers.html">Bonnie Baskin and Karen Chin</a>, Co-Directors of the Sabah Ensemble.</p>
    
    <h2>A typical class</h2>
    <p>includes a gentle but in depth warm-up series, ranging from 60 to 90 minutes. It is a mat routine on the floor, and includes yoga, modern dance exercises and creative body alignment/ideokinesis work.  In the second part of class we work on dance technique and movement exercises, often including an opportunity for improvisation/free dance. Occasionally a student or the troupe will perform for class.  Several times a year, we "Circle Dance" together (a night of structured improvisational dance) instead of the regular class format.</p>
    
    <h2>We suggest you wear</h2>
    <p>comfortable clothing.  You will usually find us wearing yoga pants or sweat pants, a t-shirt, and bare feet.  The studio we rent does not allow shoes inside the studio.  If you have special needs requiring shoes, "studio shoes" (shoes not worn outside/no black soles) are an option.</p>
    
    <h2>We suggest you bring </h2>
    <p>an exercise mat or blanket to lay on for the warm-up exercises (the studio does have a few community mats available to borrow).  We often wear hipscarves or belts for the dance portion of class, and we have a selection available for you to choose from and borrow for class. Zils are welcome, but not required. </p>
    
    <h2>We are often asked what "style of bellydance"</h2> <p>we teach (ie tribal, cabaret, etc). We teach belly dance as a Performing Art, and our ensemble's work is most closely described as Contemporary.  When you come to one of our performances, you will often see an eclectic range of work, ranging from very traditional bellydance performance all the way through to bellydance infused with modern dance techniques. You will hear traditional Middle Eastern music, as well music from other genres and cultures, and occasionally we will even have live musicians.  Our goal as a class and as an ensemble, is to give you the techniques and opportunities to express yourself creatively.  </p>
