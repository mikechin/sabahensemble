	<h2>Belly Dance From the Inside Out</h2>
	<h3>A body-mind approach to belly dancing</h3>
	<blockquote><i>“This form of movement is soft-edged.  It involves relaxation and learning to let go of tension.  Muscles that are contracted and rigid can’t do this kind of dancing.  The shimmies, stomach rolls and flutters, the camel walk and snakelike movements of the arms and hands are all expressions of the free flow of energy throughout the body.”</i></blockquote>

	<p>Our class utilizes a unique method of dance instruction from the “inside out”:  It teaches the efficient use of the body’s natural support system (the skeleton) to develop a strong center and to encourage the free flow of energy throughout the body, so that it is both released and integrated.  Belly dancing is a soft-edged form of movement that is good for people of all ages.</p>
	<p>A typical class begins with a gentle but in-depth warm-up series, ranging from 60-90 minutes.  It is a mat routine on the floor designed to awaken and engage the core muscles of the pelvis and spine, and to create a strong foundation for moving with ease and grace.  The warm-ups involve stretching, yoga, energy work, and creative body alignment/ideokinesis exercises.</p>
	<p>In the second part of class, we work on dance technique and movement exercises, often including an opportunity for improvisation/free dance.</p>
