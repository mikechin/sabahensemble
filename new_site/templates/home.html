	<h2>Belly Dance From the Inside Out</h2>
	<h3>A contemporary approach to the ancient dance form of belly dancing</h3>
	<blockquote>"When I belly dance, I feel the deepest sources of energy within myself. The movements allow me to celebrate the integration of my body, mind, and spirit. From the movements I receive a sense of wholeness, health, well-being. When I belly dance, my body feels beautiful."</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"A good belly dancer must always have dignity and an ability to express the many aspects of life: sorrow and pain as well as happiness and joy."</blockquote>

	<p>The Sabah Ensemble, founded by Jamie Miller ("Sabah"), performs and teaches belly dancing as a contemporary art. Using the classic form of belly dancing as a foundation, we incorporate the use of modern techniques – creative body alignment/ideokinesis, improvisation, visualization, energy awareness, and acting exercises – to create a unique style of movement and connection.</p>
	<p>We offer a weekly dance class [LINK TO CLASS PAGE]. You can find announcements about class as well as information on our performances here [LINK TO NEWS PAGE].</p>
	<p>We hope to share the beauty of this timeless dance with you and that it will enrich your life as it has ours.	</p>
