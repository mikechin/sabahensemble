	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<p>The Sabah Ensemble was founded by Jamie Miller “Sabah” in 1973, and her approach to dancing and teaching is still employed today in our performances and weekly dance class.  She believed in teaching belly dance as a performing art and utilizing the dance as a medium for creative and artistic expression.</p>
	<p>Jamie developed a unique method of dance instruction which incorporates elements of belly dance, yoga, Hawkins work, energy work, acting and improvisation, and creative body alignment.  This allows for the free flow of energy throughout the body, so that it is both released and integrated.</p>
	<p>Throughout her career, Jamie was committed to the creation of community and to the celebration of the diversity of human culture.  Our performances can range from very traditional belly dances set to Middle Eastern music to non-traditional or “deconstructed” work using music from other genres and cultures (for example, jazz, tango, rock, techno, industrial, Latin, Bangra) or even working in silence.</p>
	<p>Jamie’s background in many styles of dance, as well as her interest in theater and the visual arts, informed her innovative approach to belly dance as a dance of power and spirituality.  Members of the Ensemble have used the work to honor many of life’s transitions – including births, deaths, birthdays, weddings, completions of transitions – and as a way of working through emotional processes.  As Jamie once said, “A good belly dancer must always have dignity and an ability to express the many aspects of life:  sorrow and pain as well as happiness and joy.”</p>

	<p><b>Karen Chin</b> is the Director of the Sabah Ensemble.  She has enjoyed dancing all her life and often dreamed of growing up to become a go go dancer.  But all of her dancing took place in the privacy of her bedroom until she took her first belly dance class from Jamie Miller in 1982.  She has performed as a soloist and as a member of the Ensemble in a variety of venues, including festivals and fairs, restaurants, senior centers and convalescent homes, jails, and public schools.</p>
	<p>Karen has studied with André Bernard, one of the pioneers of creative body alignment/ideokinesis, as well as his long-time student, Carol Loud.  She also studied painting at UC Berkeley, where she received her MFA.</p>
	<p>In 2000 Karen, along with Bonnie Baskin and Michelle Suwczinsky, took over the directorship of the Ensemble and began to teach the “Belly Dance From the Inside Out” classes.</p>

	<p><b>Jamie Miller</b> (1942-1999) was the founder of the Sabah Ensemble.  She was a dancer and teacher who worked in the Bay Area for more than thirty-five years, and acted as Co-Director of Berkeley Moving Arts.  She received her early dance training from Lester Horton and Bella Lewitsky.  Her movement experience also included studying the work of Martha Graham with Gloria Sark, as well as Hawkins Technique with Ruth Botchan and creative body alignment/ideokinesis with André Bernard.</p>
	<p>In 1965 Jamie began performing and teaching belly dance and creative movement under the name “Sabah” (which means “morning” or “dawn” in Arabic).  Her first teacher was Roman “Bert” Balladine, one of the world’s foremost male belly dancers.  Sonia Ivanova, a highly respected Russian ballerina who taught Samia Gamal, also served as a mentor and major influence on Jamie.</p>
	<p>Jamie spent three years as an artist-in-residence at the San Francisco City and County Jail, where she taught and performed belly dance, modern dance, and improvisation to the hundreds of women incarcerated there.  She also taught middle school in Oakland.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.gildedserpent.com/Articles2/sabah.htm" target="_blank">Jamie passed away</a> from a brain tumor at the age of fifty-seven in 1999.</p>

	<p class="pull-fixed"><b>Michelle Suwczinsky</b> is a former performer and Co-Director of the Sabah Ensemble.  Although she has been dancing all of her life – predominantly in western dance forms – it was not until she began working with Jamie Miller in 1991 that her dance moved from a skill to an art form.  Her experience with the Ensemble allowed further growth, refinement, and discovery in her dance, as well as providing a medium for grounding and self-exploration in her daily life.  She retired from the Ensemble in 2011.</p>
